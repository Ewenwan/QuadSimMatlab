# QuadSimMatlab
Quadrotor simulator by Matlab. This branch is for simulation in chapter 4 of Dr. Mellinger's thesis.


# How to use it?
## BLS
Mass should be a constant number. Quad in hovering state. Approx number is displayed in command window.
Estimated value of x_{off} and mass is pretty exact.
## RLS
Mass should change regularly. Quad in an exciting trajectory. Approx number is displayed in a figure.
Estimated value of mass is pretty exact, can show trend of changing mass.

Estimated value of inertia Iyy and offset x_{off} is bad.
