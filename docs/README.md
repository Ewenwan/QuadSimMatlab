QuadSimMatlab

It is a project based on quadrotor simulation models created by Penn. 
A stable controller will be created, and several trajectory tracking algorithms will be tested by the simulator. 

Functions available now:
:   Basic control to quadrotor. Without to much excitement, it will work. 
:   Track several trajectories: fixed point, helix, line, self-defined trajectory based on five fixed points. 
:  To be continued.
